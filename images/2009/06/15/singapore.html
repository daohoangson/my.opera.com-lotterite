After two flights and a day in Singapore.<br/><br/>Arrived at Singapore at 3am, caught a shuttle bus to Terminal 2 (as always), and headed to Starbucks (after McDonald <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-p" alt="p"/>). No matter how many times I go to Singapore, I always visit that same Starbucks, sit at the same spot, and do the same thing: writing love stories (hahah). The story that some of you may already know, actually most of it was written in that Starbucks <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/>, but this time the mood went for a different story. No worries, I will finish the other one sooner or later. Promise <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-p" alt="p"/><br/><br/>In spite of swine flu, I still decided to get on MRT and go to the town as soon as sunshine filled the streets, because couldn't bear the boredom. At the station, grabbed a stranger and he became my tour guide for the whole day <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/> . Just think about how nice it is <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-wink" alt="wink"/> I guess I have a little bit of good luck with strangers from time to time <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cheers" alt="cheers"/> .  <br/><br/>Now I hope I can make the most of my time while at home. Wish you all the best as well <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/15/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-bigsmile" alt="bigsmile"/></div>
