    <div class="content">Still that song in the post before my birthday (scroll down to see <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/06/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/> ), but this is the Japanese version, supposed to be the original one. It is originally the ending theme song of a cartoon named "The cat returns" (Anyone knows? <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/06/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-whistle" alt="whistle"/>). Personally I still prefer the Chinese version, with fast pace and cute pronunciation, but since Japanese is much much easier to pronounce, these days I am singing along to this song to relax (it's like a game, really fun you know, cos you have to concentrate hardly to the written pronunciation so you don't get messed up and can catch the melody <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/06/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-wink" alt="wink"/>)<br/><br/>So now I really want to cover this song, maybe a duet with my sister, hehe. It'll be fun. Wish I could pronounce Chinese nicely so I can do the Chinese version as well. Oh, if someday I get hyper enough, maybe I'll give it Vietnamese lyrics, so can really enjoy the melody, and the version will spread widely and become a hit. Mmmm ... delicious thought! <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/06/06/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-happy" alt="happy"/><br/><br/><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/geUWKDYxt04&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="never"/><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/geUWKDYxt04&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x234900&amp;color2=0x4e9e00" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344" allowscriptaccess="never"/></object>
