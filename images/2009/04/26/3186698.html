<span class="alignright"> Why are you to tell me how to live my life?<br/>Who are you to tell me if it's black or white?<br/>(From "Have a nice day" - Bon Jovi)</span><br/><br/>Yes, this is a trivium.<br/>But if you asked me now whether I am angry, I'd say yes. I am angry and pissed off. Because so many people want to preach me. Because people think only their opinion is right, and I'm no more than just a doll, an ugly stupid doll, without any feeling, for them to do whatever they want on me. <br/><br/>I really want to say bad words right here, but I can't.<br/>!^%%$&amp;^$%#()(*&amp;*()^%#%#$)((*<br/><br/>Who do they think they are?<br/><br/>Anyway, if you can't stand me, just leave me alone. <br/>Sick of this.<br/></div>
