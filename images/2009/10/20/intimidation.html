<div id="excerpt">The fact is I am still somewhat intimidated when participating in most of my media classes!<br/>I really am!</div>
<br/>Sometimes this feeling is quite terrible and becomes a rather serious problem.<br/>I know you'll probably say I am a media person (to-be) so I'm supposed to be super confident, not to mention being shy and intimidated. I think so too, that's why I feel even worse about this.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna give any reasons (or excuses, if you want) because most of you won't understand anyway.<br/><br/>Just try to say that this is quite a big obstacle following me all along my way and I desperately want to get rid of it!<br/><br/>End of confession!</div>
