If you are my dear friends who regularly check this blog, welcome back, I just want to say thanks to you all <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-love" alt="love"/></div>
<br/>This is my personal blog, where I post my everyday random thoughts, my serious opinions, my diaries, and the like. I'm just an ordinary girl enjoying sharing my thoughts with friends (you can check more info about me in the About tab if you're curious). My most interested field is media, especially new media, and its impacts on society. You may find some posts about it, but not so many, because though I'm interested in the topic, I'm also very lazy to produce serious articles about it <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-knockout" alt="knockout"/> This blog is written in both Vietnamese (my first language) and English. Some entries are just revealed to friends in friend list, but if you are not in my list, there is still a lot of information that I set public. I also want to credit this blog design to the guy at <a href="http://my.opera.com/MyKhoangKhac" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://my.opera.com/MyKhoangKhac</a>, he's done a very good job and I must say I love it a lot. Cheers! <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cheers" alt="cheers"/><br/><br/>Archive for articles about destinations I've been to:<br/><a href="http://my.opera.com/lotterite/blog/index.dml/tag/laos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Laos</a><br/><a href="http://my.opera.com/lotterite/blog/index.dml/tag/perth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Perth</a><br/><a href="http://my.opera.com/lotterite/blog/index.dml/tag/C%C3%B4%20T%C3%B4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">C&#244; T&#244; island</a><br/><a href="http://my.opera.com/lotterite/blog/index.dml/tag/china" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">China</a><br/><a href="http://my.opera.com/lotterite/blog/index.dml/tag/bali" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bali</a><br/><br/><br/>Taking the advantage of this being a sticky post <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-bigsmile" alt="bigsmile"/>, I will also add a list of things I want to fulfill in my life, which I call "the bucket list" (if you haven't seen that movie, it's a great one <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-yes" alt="yes"/>). This list will be updated whenever I find a new thing I want to do <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-p" alt="p"/><br/><br/>1. <s>Live in Finland</s><br/>2. <s>Visit Beijing</s><br/>3. Try bungee jumping (specifically: Clarke Quay - Singapore)<br/>4. Ski<br/>5. <s>Go to Bali</s><br/>6. Go to the east coast of Australia<br/>7. Drive a Hummer<br/>8. Go to Tibet<br/>9. Publish a book<br/>...<br/><br/>(22/1/2011: The list was created in September 2009, with things that I merely dreamed about then, now over a year later, I'm proud that I have been able to make three of them come true)<br/><br/>I've got a lot in mind, but then reduced it to things that I'm really serious about. So, that's it for now guys <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-p" alt="p"/><br/><br/><span class="aligncenter">Please enjoy your time at my place <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/19/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-heart" alt="heart"/></span>
