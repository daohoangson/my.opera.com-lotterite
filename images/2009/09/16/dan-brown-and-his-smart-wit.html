The videos were so interesting and funny that once I got to watch them, I just couldn't stop but kept pressing to open other clips. <br/><br/>Dan Brown turns out be an ordinary boy (likes pogo stick and collects ... plastic spoons <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-sherlock" alt="sherlock"/>) who enjoys vlogging and posts regular videos about his everyday life, his random thoughts, or his crazy ideas. Those China clips were produced when he had his trip to China for a cultural exchange program of his university, considered his first trip ever overseas. It is always interesting to see how Western people see and experience "The East", but Dan showed it in a damn funny way of his. One vlog about his opinion of "China smells funny", some about his battle with a mosquito in the room, others about Chinese snack that he bought in Walmart, which he had no clue what it was...<br/><br/>God, I just couldn't help laughing out loud when seeing those videos. And it's not funny in a cheesy way, it's just like we are blogging, he blogs by posting videos on YouTube. After watching all 11 videos about his China trip, I pressed for more related vids and came up with his own channel. Man it's just massive. Turned out that this guy has been vlogging for years, and is one of the most popular one on YouTube (last time I saw he was celebrating his 100,000th subscriber, not sure about now). He vlogs about everything, from his crazy idea of mixing everything in a McDonalds meal to make a new ... smoothie (which turned out to be horribly awful) to politics in the US (he's a Politics student), from how to solve a rubic cube (which I believe were his very first videos on the Tube) to the issue of abortion, from his thought of Harry Potter to Jonas Brothers. Or even sometimes til the end of the video, you just roll on the floor laughing and still don't know what the vid's about. But ... whatever it is, it is just crazily funny!!! (Guarantee!!! <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-headbang" alt="headbang"/>)<br/><br/>This guy even got his own live shows on the net every week. And what's most amazing is he can make money from that as well <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-bigeyes" alt="bigeyes"/>, simple, YouTube puts ads on his videos and he got a share of it. Wow ... he is just same age as me but paying for his study, and even more important, just by sharing his thoughts. Well ... can't deny that his videos are enticing, anyway!<br/><br/>Hmm ... feeling a little bit ashamed when I'm also 19 but have done nothing for the world, oh even for family. But at least I still got a consolation that ... I've been to more countries than him <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-pirate" alt="pirate"/><br/><br/>Now just take my words and go watch his clips, I swear you won't regret <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/><br/><br/>That'll make your day <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ftGHX2QI-Q&amp;feature=SeriesPlayList&amp;p=6E9E5242F1E8FA0E" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dan's China trip series</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pogobat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dan Brown channel</a> <br/><br/>P/S: To Dan: if you search your name in Google (which I'm pretty sure you do very often, oh wait, maybe not, maybe you'll just get the results for "the other Dan Brown" <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/>) and somehow see this post, better thank me for getting you some more viewers <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2009/09/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-p" alt="p"/></div>
