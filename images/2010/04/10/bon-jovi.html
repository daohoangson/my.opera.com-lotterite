I am normally the soft, melodic music kind of person, but on those occasions I need something harder, sometimes I even need to get lost and cry in the sound of Death Metal.<br/><br/>But Bon Jovi's music is the most successful in taking me away from reality and take a good deal of bad emotions out of me. I still remember me sitting there, in the middle of a classroom, listening to "Have a nice day" by my mp3 player to stop the trembling hands and get ready for the presentation that I'd been working so hard on. <br/><br/>I remember not long ago how "Welcome to wherever you are" became the song that took the most of my tears ever. I kept crying harder and harder, non-stop, with the song played in max volume in the background. Even more when it came to the chorus.<br/><br/>I guess it is the true emotions put in every song of Jon Bon Jovi that I can relate myself to so much. Look at "Bed of Roses", who wouldn't be moved by that kind of lyrics, especially when they are in a similar situation?</div>
