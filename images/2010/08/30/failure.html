    <div class="content">I just failed.<br/><br/>Face it, I'm just not competent enough. All I had to offer was my dream, maybe they valued dreams differently, maybe dreams worth less than some other things, it's alright, just the difference in evaluation. <br/><br/>Anyway, I gave it my best, because if I had another chance, I'd still do what I did. Sometimes I wonder if it's better or worse to say the comforting line "You did your best", if I did all I could and I still failed, I must really suck then.<br/><br/>Then I tried another tactic, "You learn more from failure than from success". This one seems to work better. And I told that failed person, whose self-esteem has just been severely damaged, that you just don't let the evaluation of only 3 people in the world to decide how worthy of a person you are. True.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thank my mum a lot for using her own way to tell me that she doesn't love me less even when I fail. Mother's love, it must be infinite, for I haven't done anything to make my mum proud, and I've jsut screwed one of the few opportunities to do so.<br/><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2010/08/30/worth%20it%20%282%29.jpg"/></span>
