<span class="aligncenter"><i>Well, there are things you have to try no matter how much it costs!</i></span><br/><br/>THAT is the comforting line I've been repeating to myself for hours! The other option is to bury my face in the pillow crying for the loss of $140. Yes, 140 DOLLARS! Why didn't I learn to be a doctor, or more precisely, a dermatologist, who can grab heaps of money in exchange for just a little saliva? I don't even recall what he said now. I don't care. The only thing I care is that I walked out of the clinic gaining absolutely nothing, but losing $142 (including ATM fee, damn). A whole day of hard work was thrown out of the window. Not only money, hopes and wait were traded for NOTHING, nothing....<br/><br/>Only thing I've gained today is: I've been to a hospital in Australia for the first time!<br/>End of story!<br/><br/></div>
