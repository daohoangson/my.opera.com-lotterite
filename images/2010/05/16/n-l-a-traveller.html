    <div class="content">A few months ago a friend realised that the title of the blog, "<strong><span style="color: royalblue">lonely traveller</span></strong>", was no longer appropriate <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2010/05/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-cool" alt="cool"/>. I know. I realised it too, the reason I still kept it that way was only because I had not found anything equally cool to replace it. <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2010/05/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-whistle" alt="whistle"/><br/><br/>Nearly 2 years since the title was set, I'm still so satisfied with it (being a perfectionist, the number of things I'm satisfied with is really countable). It was inspired by Blackmore's Night's "Sake of song"<br/><span class="aligncenter"><i><span style="color: purple">And we but lonely travellers<br/>Follow a ray of light</span> </i></span><br/>The title reflects my personality and what I want to deliver in my blog so well that I didn't want to change it. I love going to different places exploring the world, and most of the time I found myself doing it alone (by "alone" I didn't mean physically lonely, but rather lonely at heart...). Not that I was bothered by that though, I am the kind that enjoys solitude, even. If I can't find a perfect partner, I'd rather do things alone. But moreover, to me, life is nothing but a long great journey, first of all is the journey searching for our soulmate, the most like-minded human being that from there will take on the journey with us; prior to that, we are all travelers, and all lonely ones.  <br/><br/>The description, '<i><span style="color: darkred">Once my ignorance was bliss</span></i>', again, didn't come out meaninglessly from nowhere. It's from Kamelot's song 'Abandoned', referring to a period in my life that I wasn't so much happy.<br/><br/>Now that both do not fit the situation any more, and also I've decided the new title, so I'll change them. It will be from Bon Jovi's '<span style="color: orangered"><strong>Destination Anywhere</strong></span>': <i><span style="color: crimson">Name the place and I'll be there</span></i> <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2010/05/16/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-headbang" alt="headbang"/><br/><br/><br/><br/>P/S: Title of this post means "Not-Lonely-Anymore Traveller", said by the one who made me have to change all this!</div>
