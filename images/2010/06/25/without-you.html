    <div class="content">On the thinking about Julia Gillard being the first female PM ever of Australia, I was back to the old question that is, why women usually have to sacrifice their family life for a really high position in society, whereas it is so much easier for men to have both. <br/><br/>Then I came with the answer: Women are capable of looking after the family all by themselves in the absence of their husbands' support, while men simply just do not have that ability. <br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2010/06/25/without%20you.jpeg.jpg"/></span>
