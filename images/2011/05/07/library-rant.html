<i>This post is supposed to be uploaded months ago when I first came to Finland, but only now when I'm about to leave I'm able to finish it. So bear in mind that I wrote most of it quite a while ago.</i><br/><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/library.jpg"/></span><br/><br/>Since I got no life and my only human interaction is talking ON SKYPE with my boyfriend, the rest of the time is spent on YouTube and READING.</div>
<br/>Seriuosly, if you know me, you may also know how obsessed I am with books. When I left Perth after 3 years, my books weighed more than all the rest of my belongings combined. My favourite destination in Perth is also the State library (a.k.a. Alexander library), which I call my "soul asylum", where I encountered several unforgettable (in all kinds of ways) people during my first year. I even loved it so much that I noticed when they changed the toilet paper from one-ply to two-ply, or when they dismissed the weird blue light in the ground-floor toilets which were said to be to inhibit people injecting drugs (in library toilets?) since they couldn't see their veins. Anyway, that's another story <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-knockout" alt="knockout"/><br/><br/>So before even going to Finland I already told myself that I had to try out the library in Turku. And today I did. It's smaller than Alexander library, but in some parts more exciting, like cool chilling out areas. Also, you don't have to put your bag in a locker in order to enter the library (although the new electronic lockers in Alexander are cool), but on the other hand, you need a LIBRARY CARD to use the restrooms in Turku library. I mean, how weird is that, although the cards are free to obtain, but library should be a public place, what's the point of limiting the use of restrooms? When I was in Perth, I used to just go to State library to use the restrooms, because it's much nicer and cleaner there than other public toilets around. I don't know about other people but I feel like when you judge a place, its toilet is quite of a valuable measure, whether it's dirty or clean, simple or fancy, under good maintenance or run down, free or charged, says a lot about the place.<br/><br/>But other than that, Turku library is cool in many ways. It pays attention to the details and has cool designs which is typical Finnish. The first floor is actually a lot larger than one expects when she first enters the building, because keep going through the newspaper area there will be a connection to another room so much bigger and with lots and lots of different kinds of fiction and non-fiction books. Then on the second floor, this little stairway leads to another small section of the library:<br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2058.jpg"/></span><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2062.jpg"/></span> <br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2063.jpg"/></span> <br/>From there you can see the whole second floor:<br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2059.jpg"/></span><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2061.jpg"/></span> <br/>But what I loveabout Turku library the most is its area on the first floor for children and young adults, that is where the coolness of the library shows.<br/><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2066.jpg"/></span><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2073.jpg"/></span> <br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/05/07/IMG_2074.jpg"/></span><br/>I have both of these.
