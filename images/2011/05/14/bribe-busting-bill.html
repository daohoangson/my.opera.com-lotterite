Photo: Rebecca Hale, NGM Staff  <br/><br/>In India, where corruption costs the public and private sectors millions of dollars a year, demands for petty bribes are frequently signaled in code: &#8220;Take care of me&#8221; or, for a two-note handout, &#8220;Make Gandhi smile twice.&#8221; Illegal demands by police and bureaucrats are &#8220;deeply ingrained in the culture,&#8221; says anticorruption crusader Vijay Anand, and are &#8220;taken as the norm.&#8221;<br/><br/>But 5th Pillar, Anand&#8217;s grassroots citizens group, is trying to create a new norm&#8212;by printing and passing out notes worth nothing at all (above). Since 2007, 5th Pillar has distributed 1.3 million zero-rupee bills. People give them as a polite protest to officials trying to squeeze extra payment for routine services like issuing driver&#8217;s licenses or loans. The effect has been to shame or scare some public servants&#8212;who can go to jail if they&#8217;re caught&#8212;into honest behavior. The zero-rupee note, says anticorruption researcher Fumiko Nagano, emboldens people to assert their rights, because when they&#8217;re backed up by 5th Pillar, &#8220;they realize they are not alone.&#8221;<br/><br/>Nor is India. Zero-currency notes are spreading to help fight corruption in Mexico and Nepal as well&#8212;an affirmation of nonviolent resistance that would surely have made Gandhi smile for real. &#8212;<i>Hannah Bloch</i><br/><br/><br/>Can't Vietnam have some initiative like this too?</div>
