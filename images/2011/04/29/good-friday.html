    <div class="content">It's been a tradition for me to mark every Good Friday by a random post since 2008 (when I still used another blog). This year I didn't forget, but we were on the road with no Internet access so it has to be delayed 'til now. <br/><br/>Remember my Good Friday post last year? (Read the posts of the last 2 years <a href="http://my.opera.com/lotterite/blog/index.dml/tag/good%20friday" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>) I said "I have so much left to say to you", because I was thinking about next Good Friday I might happen to be in Finland, but things were too uncertain to say it out loud. Little did I know, not only I made it to Finland, but on the exact time of Good Friday this year, I was travelling in 2 European cities, Amsterdam and Hamburg. Even I did not expect this. Wow!!!<br/><br/>But at the same time, a teeny tiny little bit in me missed having hot cross buns for Easter, and discounted chocolate after the holiday. I could find none here. However, at least Finland has some food of its own to celebrate this holiday, so right now I'm eating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4mmi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">m&#228;mmi</a>, a traditional Finnish Easter dessert which I had a chance to try before. It's quite hard to eat, to say the least... <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/04/29/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-bigsmile" alt="bigsmile"/><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/04/29/IMG_3069%20(600%20x%20450).jpg"/></span> <br/><br/>But I'm happy <img src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/04/29/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-smile" alt="smile"/></div>
