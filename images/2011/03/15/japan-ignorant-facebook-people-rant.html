    <div class="content">Long time I haven't posted any personal stuff/thoughts because I think it's just immature to do so, I hate it when I have to read a blog that is written like a day-to-day diary so I suppose people feel the same when they read mine. At the end who cares what you do during the day/how your emotional crisis is anyway.<br/><br/>But today I'm gonna rant here cos I couldn't care less.<br/><br/>So, the problem is, I can't concentrate on studying with all the things going on at the moment. I mean, the world's trembling (even literally) and yet people are still so ignorant and stupid, I feel like I'm supposed to do much better things right now than reading about how all the economic models I've learned to date are not applicable. Which I'm not. I can't do anything.<br/><br/>The only thing I can do and I do on Facebook is to fight stupidity (which is tiring, I tell you). Sounds lame. I know.<br/><br/>Anyway, if I were the Minister of Education, critical thinking is the first and foremost skill of students I'll focus on developing. This is another way of saying I think critical thinking is an utterly important skill to possess, especially in the age of overloaded information like this, not to imply the possibility of me being Minister of Education. Well, the explanation sounds unnecessary, we all know I'm not gonna be minister of anything. Yeah, right, I'm gonna be Prime Minister baby. Just kidding. Not really.<br/><br/>The rant could go on, but I realise this doesn't help. I feel like my thoughts are always gonna explode in my head these days but I rarely have anyone to confide to. I need a real (thoughtful, like-minded) person, not a screen.<br/><br/><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="http://blog.truongthuyngan.com/wp-content/myopera/2011/03/15/holy%20water.jpg"/></span>
